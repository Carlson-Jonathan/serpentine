Serpentine by Jonathan Carlson

This was one of my very first coding projects in Python. Watching and copying a YouTube tutorial, I 
created the basic snake game from the 1970s, then took it a few steps further by adding things like
multiple randomly generating water traps, colors and textures, sound effects, music, and even 
multi-threading to create an animated water effect. The purpose behind this project was just to get me
familiar with how coding works- not necessarily a project on good coding practice or style.
